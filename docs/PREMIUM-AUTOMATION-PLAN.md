Attendance increase: 35% → 58% (66% improvement)
```

#### **Conference Lead Capture Flow**
```
Teacher scans QR at conference booth
  ↓
Instant SMS (within 30 seconds):
"Thanks for stopping by our booth! Here's your free lesson pack:
[link] Reply with questions anytime. -Charles from ModelIt"

              questions. Also, we have a free pilot program if
              you'd like to try it with your class: [link]"
```

**Conversion rate:** 25% (vs 5% email-only)

### SMS Best Practices

**When to Use SMS:**
- ✅ Time-sensitive (webinar starting soon, event today)
- ✅ High-value action needed (pilot deadline, limited spots)
- ✅ Personal invitation (1-on-1 outreach to hot leads)
- ✅ Appointment confirmations (1-on-1 coaching calls)

**When NOT to use SMS:**
- ❌ Marketing blasts (use email instead)
- ❌ Long-form content (use email)
- ❌ Cold leads (permission-based only)
- ❌ Frequent updates (max 2-3 SMS per month per contact)

### Compliance
- ✅ **Opt-in required** (get permission via form checkbox)
- ✅ **Opt-out always available** (reply STOP to unsubscribe)
- ✅ **Clear sender identification** (include "from ModelIt" or "from Charles")
- ✅ **TCPA compliant** (text only between 8am-9pm local time)

### Cost Analysis
- Base: $20/month
- SMS cost: $0.0075 per message
- Monthly volume: 2,000 SMS (500 contacts × 4 messages/month)
- SMS charges: 2,000 × $0.0075 = $15
- **Total: $35/month**

**ROI:**
- 500 webinar attendees × 23% attendance boost = 115 additional attendees
- 115 attendees × 10% pilot conversion = 11 additional pilots
- 11 pilots × $500 value = $5,500 revenue
- **ROI: 15,614%** ($5,500 / $35)

## 🎥 System 11: Video Marketing Platform (NEW)

### What It Does
Professional video hosting with advanced analytics, lead capture, and conversion tracking:
- Host webinar recordings with engagement heatmaps
- Create video lessons with in-video CTAs
- Track who watches what (lead scoring)
- A/B test video thumbnails and titles
- Capture emails before video access

### Use Cases

#### **Webinar Replay Strategy**
```
Old way (YouTube):
  - Upload to YouTube unlisted
  - Send link in email
  - Zero tracking of who watches
  - Can't capture emails from video page
  - No conversion tracking

New way (Wistia):
  - Upload to Wistia
  - Create custom landing page with email gate
  - Track individual viewer engagement:
    * Who watched (email required)
    * How much they watched (75%+ = hot lead)
    * Which parts they rewatched (interest signals)
    * Did they click CTA? (conversion tracking)
  - Auto-trigger follow-up based on behavior:
    * Watched <25%: Send "Was it helpful?" survey
    * Watched 25-75%: Send related resource
    * Watched 75%+: Send pilot invitation (hot lead!)
    * Clicked CTA: Personal outreach within 24 hrs
```

#### **Video Email Campaigns**
```
Subject: "🎬 Watch: How Mrs. Johnson Uses ModelIt (4 min)"

Email contains:
  - Wistia video player (plays in email!)
  - Or thumbnail linked to landing page
  - CTA below video: "Try this in your classroom"

Wistia tracks:
  - Email opens (who saw the email)
  - Play rate (who clicked play)
  - Engagement (how much they watched)
  - Click-through (who clicked CTA)

Result: 3x higher engagement vs text-only emails
```

#### **Video-Based Lead Magnets**
```
Landing page: "Free Video Course: 5 Ways to Teach NGSS with Simulations"

Visitor enters email → Unlocks video playlist
  Video 1: Why simulations? (3 min)
  Video 2: Getting started (5 min)
  Video 3: Classroom management tips (4 min)
  Video 4: Assessment strategies (6 min)
  Video 5: Pilot program overview (8 min)

Each video has CTA:
  - Video 1-4: "Download lesson templates"
  - Video 5: "Join our pilot program"

Wistia tracks completion:
  - Completed 1 video: Warm lead
  - Completed 3 videos: Hot lead
  - Completed all 5: Personal outreach immediately

Conversion rate: 35% (vs 5% with text-based lead magnet)
```

### Advanced Features

**Engagement Heatmaps:**
- See which parts of video get rewatched (high interest)
- Identify drop-off points (boring sections)
- Optimize future videos based on data

**A/B Testing:**
- Test 2 thumbnails (which gets more clicks?)
- Test 2 titles (which drives more views?)
- Test CTA placement (beginning, middle, or end?)

**Turnstile Email Capture:**
- Require email at 30 seconds into video
- "Enter email to continue watching"
- Captures highly engaged leads only

### Cost Decision: Vimeo vs Wistia

**Start with Vimeo Pro ($20/month):**
- Cheaper ($20 vs $100)
- Good enough for Year 1
- Still better than YouTube (privacy, branding)

**Upgrade to Wistia ($100/month) when:**
- Video is core to your funnel
- Revenue >$10k/month (justify the cost)
- Need advanced tracking and personalization
- Ready for enterprise features

**For now: Budget $20/month for Vimeo Pro**

## 📰 System 14: Publication & PR Automation (NEW)

### What It Does
Systematically gets ModelIt featured in educational publications, journals, media outlets, and podcasts to build credibility and reach educators at scale.

### Target Publications (From Original Plan)

**Practitioner Journals (Peer-Reviewed):**
- Science Scope (NSTA) - Middle school teachers
- Connected Science Learning - Formal + informal educators
- The Science Teacher - High school teachers
- Journal of Science Teacher Education - Teacher educators/researchers

**General Education Platforms:**
- Edutopia - Tens of thousands of teacher readers
- MiddleWeb - Middle school focus
- Education Week - Policy/admin audience
- TeachThought - Progressive education
- EdSurge - EdTech focus

**Media Outlets:**
- NPR Science Friday (podcast + radio)
- The74Million (education news)
- EdWeek Market Brief (edtech industry)
- eSchool News
- District Administration

### Automation Workflow

#### **Phase 1: Publication Database (Setup)**
```
Create database in HubSpot:
  Publication name
  Focus area (middle school, NGSS, edtech, etc.)
  Submission process (pitch editor vs open submission)
  Contact info (editor name, email)
  Deadlines (monthly column vs quarterly journal)
  Notes (what they're looking for)

Sources:
  - Manual research (1 time, 4 hours)
  - Maintain ongoing (add new as discovered)

Result: 50+ publications in CRM
```

#### **Phase 2: Content Calendar (GPT-4 Assisted)**
```
For each publication, GPT-4 generates 3 article ideas:

Example (Science Scope - middle school teachers):
  1. "Making Invisible Biology Visible: Teaching Immune System with Simulations"
  2. "From Passive to Active: Transforming Middle School Science with Modeling"
  3. "How Micro Mayhem Gets Students Excited About Cell Biology"

For each idea, generate:
  - 200-word pitch (what, why, how)
  - Outline (3-5 main points)
  - Target publication fit (why this journal?)
  - Teacher takeaways (what readers will learn)

Store in content calendar with submission deadlines
```

#### **Phase 3: Pitch Automation**
```
n8n workflow:
  1. Check calendar daily for upcoming submission deadlines
  2. If pitch due in 7 days:
     - GPT-4 expands outline into full draft (1,500 words)
     - Charles reviews and edits (30 min vs 3 hrs writing)
     - Format for publication guidelines (auto-adjusted)
  3. Send pitch email to editor:
     - Personalized intro (mention recent articles)
     - Article summary (200 words)
     - Why it fits their audience
     - Author bio + credentials
     - Attach full draft or offer to write
  4. Track in HubSpot:
     - Stage: Pitched
     - Follow-up reminder in 14 days if no response
```

**Result:** Submit 2-4 article pitches per month (vs 0-1 manual)

#### **Phase 4: Follow-Up & Publishing**
```
Automation handles:
  - Pitch accepted → Move to "Writing" stage
  - Draft submitted → Move to "Under review"
  - Revisions requested → Reminder to complete
  - Published → Celebrate! + Promote

Post-publication automation:
  - Share on all social platforms (Ayrshare)
  - Email to list: "We were featured in Edutopia!"
  - Add "As featured in" badge to website
  - Repurpose content:
    * Turn article into 5 social posts
    * Create email sequence based on article
    * Record podcast episode expanding on topic
    * Use as webinar presentation
```

### Press Release Distribution

```
1. Write press release (GPT-4 draft + human edit)
2. Identify target journalists (HubSpot database)
3. Personalized email outreach:
   "Hi [Name],

   Saw your recent piece on [article]. Thought you might be
   interested in this story: [1-sentence hook]

   [2-3 sentence summary]

   Happy to chat or send full release. Let me know!

   -Charles"

4. Track opens and responses
5. Follow up with interested journalists
6. Coordinate interviews/quotes
```

- Q1: Convert 100 Year 1 pilots to paid ($80,000)
- Q2: Add 100 new schools ($80,000)
- Q3: Add 100 new schools ($80,000)
- Q4: Add 100 new schools ($80,000)

**Districts (20 × $15,000 = $300,000):**
- Hire 1 enterprise sales rep Month 7 ($60k salary + commission)
- Target 100-teacher+ districts (easier than individual schools)
- Close 5 per quarter (1 demo → 1 close rate = 20 demos/quarter)

**TPT ($120,000):**
- Maintain current momentum
- Release 2 new products per quarter (24 total products by end Year 2)
- Build reputation as go-to NGSS simulation resource

**Professional Development ($150,000):**
- Offer district-wide PD as upsell
- Host 2 online cohorts per quarter ($3,000 × 8 cohorts = $24,000)
- Conference workshops become paid gigs ($1,500 × 30 = $45,000)

**Partnerships ($100,000):**
- Close Carolina deal (Q2)
- Close Pearson deal (Q3)
- Close McGraw-Hill (Q4)

**Is this realistic?**
- ✅ **Yes, if automation works** (can handle 500+ schools without hiring army)
- ✅ **Yes, if quality maintained** (premium product justifies $800/school)
- ✅ **Yes, if partnerships close** (publisher deals are 6-12 month sales cycles)
- ✅ **Yes, if we execute** (premium automation plan makes it possible)
