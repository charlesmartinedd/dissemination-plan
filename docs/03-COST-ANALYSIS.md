## 🚨 Hidden Costs to Avoid

**Common Pitfalls (We're NOT Falling For):**

### ❌ Tool Sprawl
- **Mistake:** Sign up for 20 different tools "just in case"
- **Cost:** $500+/month in unused subscriptions
- **Solution:** Stick to 5 core tools, add only when needed

### ❌ Premium Tiers Too Early
- **Mistake:** Buy Mailchimp Premium ($350/month) with 50 contacts
- **Cost:** $350/month wasted on features you don't use
- **Solution:** Start free/low tier, upgrade only when limits hit

### ❌ Hiring Too Soon
- **Mistake:** Hire social media manager ($3k/month) before automation tested
- **Cost:** $3k/month + time to manage them
- **Solution:** Automate first, hire only when automation can't scale further

### ❌ Custom Development
- **Mistake:** Pay developer $5k to build custom CRM
- **Cost:** $5k + ongoing maintenance
- **Solution:** Use Google Sheets + n8n (free, works great)

### ❌ Not Tracking ROI
- **Mistake:** Spend $500/month on tools, no idea if they work
- **Cost:** Wasted money on ineffective channels
- **Solution:** Track everything (our analytics dashboard does this)
